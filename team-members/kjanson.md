Hello, I am Kai Janson, and yes, I do not have a middle name.
I was born and raised in Germany, about 55 revolutions around the sun ago.

My first contact with computers goes back to a Tandy/Radioshack TRS-Model II.
A friend of mine owned it and he programmed this marble of technology, creating
a maze game. The machine had a whopping amount of 4kByte RAM and it used a
cassette tape recorder as its storage medium for the "code" he wrote.
Another friend of mine helped us to upgrade the hardware to a staggering amount
of a mindblowing 16kByte of RAM; more than we could possibly use in our lifetime.

My interest had been awoken and has never rested since.

I bought my first computer, an Amiga 1000, by bantering. I owned a Nakamichi Cassette Recorder,
and a friend of mine owned said computer. Both were worth the same amount of money
(about 1,600 Deutsch Mark back then), and we traded.

Now with this machine, I was able to do more stuff than just dabbling in BASIC.
I learned AMIGA Basic by Commodore, which was nothing short of horrific.
My interest grew into understanding the Operating System and as such I discovered that
most of the AmigaDOS layer was written in BCPL. Horribly slow, cumbersome and hard to maintain.

So I went and learned C and Assembly language on the then 68000 CPU at about 8MHz clockspeed.
At first I learned AmigaDOS, then I rewrote many of the day-by-day commands, like ls and dir,
less, and others in 100% Assembly languge.  More and more complex tools followed and I learned
C by writing a GUI to an 100% CLI driven C compiler. That was also my entry point in writing
application with a user interface.  My friends were the first beta tester of my software
pieces I wrote.

AmigaDOS had been taken from a VAX and Commodore stuck it into the Amiga, which in turn made
it "somewhat-UN*X-alike".  Many commands were similar or even the same.

That sparked my interest into UN\*X. I aqcuired a SUN SPARC Classic and I was off to the races.
Learning all the needed commands, the update of the OS and installation of packages and patches
were my daily, non-professional bread.  After a few weeks, I was a self proclaimed UN\*X System Admin
and applied for a job a such ... and got it!

A SPARC Station 5 was my next acquisition.
My friends were like, "What are you doing? You will never be able to turn this into a profession.
Who in their right mind is using this thing, what you call it: UN\*X? Windows 3.11 to the rescue!"

I did not listen. I went with UN\*X.  At that time, I got my hands on SLACKWARE LINUX as an add-on
to a computer magazin.  I took the CD and installed it.  Well, sort of. It broke about 50% into
the installation. I was determined.  I can fix it!!! I learned about all the wonderful things
you can do with LINUX without the internet.  Well, the internet was not even invented yet.
So, I fixed my installation, got the system up and running on LINUX kernel 0.96a. Yep, it worked.

Then many LINUX flavors started to pop up. Mandrake, SUSE, Debian, Corel LINUX (remember CorelDraw?)
and many more.  I got my hands on all of them, installed them, tweaked them and destroyed the
installations and learned more. Then I found the BSD side of things.  I built kernels from scratch
with the aid of a kernel config program.  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, ... you name it. To this day I
prefer BSD based stuff over LINUX for some applications (like macOS, but I digress).

Before I knew it, I was knee-deep in the UN\*X world and never looked at Windows again.

Fast forward many years, I am stil in the LINUX, UN\*X world and still love it.

I hope that I can bring my passion and the love for programming, System Administration and many of
other disciplines that I picked over the years to TAOS and enrich the souls of many.
