# Victor Secarin

I have spent half of my working life as a programmer in Romania and then the other half in Canada, first programming (C and C++) and then progressing through teams that changed their name from, initially, 'build and install team' all the way to 'DevOps Team' and/or 'System Reliability Team'. I have made makefiles, packages, installation scripts, kept learning the new tech and always enjoyed the variety. I seriously believe continuous learning can make one live longer.

I have been introduced to remote work in the spring of 2020 and never stepped into an office again.

In my spare time I like reading and sometimes a long walk.
