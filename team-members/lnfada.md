I have spent half of my working life as a as a IT assistant. I have always loved IT and moved here from Cameroon.  

My passion is to teach and share the little knowledge that I have with others.

I have always loved remote work and have been working remotely for as long as I can remember. 

In my spare time I like reading the Bible and doing some podcasts as well.
